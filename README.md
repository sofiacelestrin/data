How to run code:
1. Clone my repository onto your machine
2. Run this line to build the code: g++ -std=c++17 InMemoryDB.cpp -o test
3. Run ./test
   
How assignment should be modified:
To make this an official assignment, I feel that there should be a bit more clarification in the assignment details on what functions should be written and what their expected 
functionality is. I think it would also help to create a testing suite so that students can test their code and create a program that is more aligned to how it will be graded.
I think that providing a template for the program could also be useful, but overall I think that this assignment would be a good addition. If these small changes were made I think 
it could be easy to understand and useful for students. 

(consider clarifications to the instructions, different methods that should be written, more effective ways to grade, or any other aspect!)
